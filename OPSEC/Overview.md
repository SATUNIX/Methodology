# **OPSEC & Obfuscation for Pentesting**

## **Scenario:**
In high-stakes penetration testing, **remaining undetectable and untraceable** is crucial. This guide covers **advanced operational security (OPSEC) techniques** at each phase of an engagement. The goal is to **evade detection, minimize forensic traces, and prevent attribution** while executing attacks.

# **🛠 Step 1: Pre-Engagement OPSEC (Planning & Infrastructure) (T1583, T1584, T1595)**
**Objective:** Prepare infrastructure and attack vectors while avoiding early detection.

### **1.1 Infrastructure Setup & Anonymity**
- **Use disposable virtualized environments** (Qubes OS, Whonix, Tails, ephemeral VMs).
- **Decentralized C2 Setup** (Mythic, Sliver, Havoc) with **multi-tiered proxies & relays**.
- **Rented VPS with no direct link to attacker** (cryptocurrency payments, privacy-focused hosts). (Mulvad VPN is an option to leverage)
- **Burner cloud accounts** (AWS, GCP, Azure) with fake identities, sockpuppets etc. 
- **Automated log cleansing** on jump boxes, servers, and workstations.
- Alternatively can use on prem infrastructure, and take multiple obfuscation steps as listed above. 

### **1.2 Pre-Engagement Recon & OPSEC Considerations**
- **Passive recon only** (Maltego, Google Dorking, crt.sh, WHOIS lookups via third-party APIs).
- **Avoid making DNS queries directly**—use **public resolvers** (Quad9, Cloudflare, Google) or **Tor**.
- **Enumerate targets via disposable VPNs** (Mullvad, IVPN, self-hosted OpenVPN over VPS chain).
- **Time-based browsing habits** (blend in with normal business hours for web scraping, recon bots).

### **1.3 Secure Communications**
- **Use end-to-end encrypted messengers** (Signal, Matrix, Tox) instead of corporate email.
- **Dedicated secure VM for comms**—never mix operational comms with attack environments.
- **Modify browser fingerprints** (Anti-detect browsers like Kameleo, GoLogin).

# **📡 Step 2: Initial Access OPSEC (Exploitation & Payload Deployment) (T1566, T1190, T1203)**
**Objective:** Exploit targets without triggering alarms or leaving forensic traces.

### **2.1 Payload Generation & Obfuscation**
- **Evasive payloads** (Shellcode injection into legitimate processes, encrypted loaders).
- **Custom packers & crypters** (Avoid signature-based detection via PE manipulation, RunPE, Gobfuscate). (make your own packer from scratch and keep it to yourself)
- **In-memory execution** (Reflective DLL injection, Process Hollowing, Direct Syscalls to evade user-mode hooks).
- **Stage payloads through legitimate CDNs** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, AWS S3 signed URLs).
- **Signed binaries abuse** (Living-off-the-land techniques: MSBuild, InstallUtil, Regsvr32, etc.).

### **2.2 Phishing & Social Engineering OPSEC**
- **Disposable email addresses** (Burner ProtonMail, Tutanota, temporary inboxes).
- **Domain fronting for phishing sites** (Legitimate-looking HTTPS endpoints for C2 comms).
- **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) for stealthy command execution** to bypass security filters.

### **2.3 Exploitation & Persistence Without Attribution**
- **Deploy beacons over encrypted DNS (DoH), ICMP, or HTTP/2 to blend into normal traffic.**
- **Limit outbound connections**—never connect to C2 servers directly from home IP.
- **Use time-jittered execution** (Execute payloads only during business hours to mimic real traffic).

# **🔑 Step 3: Post-Exploitation & Evasion (Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement) (T1055, T1071, T1090)**
**Objective:** Move within the environment without being detected or leaving forensic evidence.

### **3.1 Privilege Escalation Without Detection**
- **Token theft vs. credential dumping** (Mimikatz detection is high; use token impersonation where possible).
- **Unhook security tools** (Direct Syscalls instead of WinAPI, Patch AMSI & ETW logging).
- **Abuse legitimate admin tools** (PsExec, WMI, PowerShell Remoting, schtasks for stealthy persistence).
- **Kerberos abuse** (Pass-the-Ticket instead of dumping LSASS, Silver Tickets for stealthy lateral movement).

### **3.2 Lateral Movement OPSEC**
- **Hide in normal admin traffic** (Use RDP over legitimate IT VPNs, SMB Pivoting with named pipes).
- **Use encrypted channels for lateral movement** (SSH tunnels, NTLM relay attacks over SOCKS proxies).
- **Abuse misconfigured network shares** (Copy payloads over SYSVOL for AD persistence).

### **3.3 Data Collection & Exfiltration Without Detection**
- **Use compression & encryption** (WinRAR with AES encryption, 7z self-extracting archives with passphrase).
- **Exfiltrate data over covert channels** (DNS tunneling, ICMP-based exfil, exfiltrating via Slack/Webhooks).
- **Fragment large payloads into small chunks** (Evade SIEM/EDR detection by splitting files & reassembling outside).

---

# **🏆 Step 4: Persistence & Covering Tracks (T1070, T1098, T1564)**
**Objective:** Maintain long-term access while eliminating forensic traces.

### **4.1 Achieving Long-Term Persistence**
- **Modify Group Policy (GPO) to deploy stealthy scheduled tasks.**
- **Backdooring trusted scripts** (Modify PowerShell profiles, persistence through logon scripts).
- **Tampering with Event Log policies** (Disable PowerShell logging for specific users, clear event logs on reboot).

### **4.2 Clearing Logs & Anti-Forensics**
- **Selective log deletion** (Use API calls to remove logs instead of wiping full event logs, raising suspicion).
- **Tampering with forensic artifacts** (Modify timestamps of files, disable Sysmon logging temporarily).
- **Wiping forensic evidence on exit** (Secure delete tools, Overwrite memory regions before process termination).

---

# **🛑 Step 5: Exit Strategies & OPSEC Fail-Safes (T1027, T1568, T1202)**
**Objective:** Secure a clean exit while preventing attribution.

### **5.1 Controlled Exit Without Detection**
- **Kill all active sessions & terminate C2 implants** (Automatically delete scheduled tasks, remove registry keys).
- **Delete all exfiltrated data from staging servers** (Shredder scripts, ephemeral cloud storage with auto-purge policies).
- **Use timed execution for cleanup scripts** (Ensure traces are wiped only after confirmed exfil completion).

### **5.2 OPSEC Fail-Safes & Redundancy**
- **Have fallback C2 channels in case of premature detection.**
- **Use layered encryption** (GPG/PGP encrypt sensitive logs & credentials before exfil).
- **Implement auto-destruct mechanisms on implants if tampered with.**
