# **Pentesting Methodology**

Documented notes, process, and techniques used previously. 

## **Overview**
This repository contains **methodologies** for penetration testing, CTFs HTBs etc across various domains, including **Active Directory, Web Applications, Networks, and more**. The structure of this library ensures that methodologies are organized, and easy to follow.
This is broken down into the methods I have used in past for testing and provide an overview to help structure your planning and playbooks. 
Each methodology consists of:
- **Overview & Preliminary Basics** â€“ General knowledge, prerequisites, and example commands.
- **Detailed Methodology Listings** â€“ Step-by-step approaches.
- **External Resources** â€“ Links to manuals, official documentation, and advanced reading materials. (use the main resources.md)

## **ðŸ›  How to Use This Library**
1. Start with the **overview.md** file to understand **general pentesting concepts & common commands**.
2. Navigate to the relevant **category directory** for a specific methodology.
3. Each category contains **detailed methodology documents**, overview for basics and initial tests, and then listings for everything i could think of, just doesnt have example syntax. 
4. Refer to the **resources.md** for further reading, including official documentation, whitepapers, and detailed guides.

I strongly recommend you develop your own methodologies, you will otherwise find yourself stuck. Beyond technical understanding there is the the knowledge of the what and when. (Beyond the 'how'). 
Only this will develop the best tester out of someone. There is no use in knowing 'how' to do everything if you dont know when and where to do it.

While tools are an essential part of penetration testing, they should never be relied upon blindly. Understanding how the underlying technology works is critical, as tools evolve, become obsolete, or may not function as expected in real-world scenarios. To stay ahead, you must continuously learn, experiment, and practiceâ€”developing your own scripts and techniques rather than depending solely on automation. Throughout this guide, various tools may be listed as examples, but they may not be accurate or relevant at the time of reading. 

It is also encouraged not to just blindly use these command examples on step by step as these examples are just that, an example. The commands and tools listed provide an idea of what the step and objective is, understand the method, the tecnique, and how it intertwines with following methods and steps. Take notes and practice. 

Instead of relying on predefined tools, focus on understanding the documentation, read the PTES, and NIST guides on pentesting, understand the technology and how it can be used, understand the technical details, and step-by-step methods and techniques behind them. Adapt your approach based on the objectives required, ensuring you are not just a tool user but a true security practitioner capable of thinking critically and adapting to new challenges.
