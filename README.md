# **Pentesting Methodology**

## **Overview**
This repository contains **methodologies** for penetration testing, CTFs HTBs etc across various domains, including **Active Directory, Web Applications, Networks, and more**. The structure of this library ensures that methodologies are organized, and easy to follow.
This is broken down into the methods I have used in past for testing and provide an overview to help structure your planning and playbooks. 
Each methodology consists of:
- **Overview & Preliminary Basics** â€“ General knowledge, prerequisites, and example commands.
- **Detailed Methodology Listings** â€“ Step-by-step approaches.
- **External Resources** â€“ Links to manuals, official documentation, and advanced reading materials. (use the main resources.md)

## **ðŸ›  How to Use This Library**
1. Start with the **overview.md** file to understand **general pentesting concepts & common commands**.
2. Navigate to the relevant **category directory** for a specific methodology.
3. Each category contains **detailed methodology documents**, overview for basics and initial tests, and then listings for everything i could think of, just doesnt have example syntax. 
4. Refer to the **resources.md** for further reading, including official documentation, whitepapers, and detailed guides.

I strongly recommend you develop your own methodologies, you will otherwise find yourself stuck. Beyond technical understanding there is the the knowledge of the what and when. (Beyond the 'how'). 
Only this will develop the best tester out of someone. There is no use in knowing 'how' to do everything if you dont know when and where to do it.
